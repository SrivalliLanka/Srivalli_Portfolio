  paragraphs:
    - "I'm a Master's student in Information Management at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a strong interest in using data and AI to solve real-world problems. I currently maintain a 4.0 GPA and enjoy working across analytics, machine learning, and data-driven storytelling."
    - "Before graduate school, I worked at Deloitte as a Network Engineer, where I gained hands-on experience with large-scale enterprise systems and learned how technology decisions play out in real operational environments. That experience shaped my interest in building data solutions that are both technically sound and practically useful."
    - "Today, I work as a Research Assistant at RailTEC, analyzing freight-train derailment risk using statistical modeling and text analysis, and as a Data Analyst for CHIME-in, where I study the relationship between extreme heat and public health outcomes using statewide climate and health data."
    - "I enjoy turning complex, messy data into clear insights, whether through modeling, visualization, or AI-driven applications, and I'm motivated by work that blends analytical rigor with real-world impact."

      title: "RailTEC — Freight Rail Safety Research"
      shortDescription: "Ongoing applied research program focused on understanding freight rail safety through statistical modeling, exploratory data analysis, and text analytics."
      detailedDescription:
        - "RailTEC is an ongoing applied research program focused on understanding freight rail safety through statistical modeling, exploratory data analysis, and text analytics. The work emphasizes methodological rigor, interpretability, and responsible use of data rather than finalized results or deployed systems."
        - "The research is organized into multiple independent workstreams, each addressing a specific analytical question related to derailment frequency, data structure, or reporting consistency. All workstreams are currently in exploratory or research-development stages."
        - "👉 <strong>Detailed explanations, workflows, and visuals for each workstream are presented in the accompanying slide deck, which documents the research structure, methods, and current status in a clear, visual format.</strong>"
        - "<strong>Research Scope at a Glance:</strong> The RailTEC research program currently includes derailment rate modeling using Poisson and Negative Binomial regression, exposure and segment-level model design for rate interpretation, conceptual exploration of zero-heavy count models, NLP-based consistency analysis of accident narratives, and literature review on derailment severity modeling. Each workstream is treated as a standalone research inquiry, rather than as a single combined project."

      title: "Carely — A Memory-Augmented AI Companion"
      shortDescription: "An AI companion designed to support seniors with daily routines, emotional well-being, and memory, while prioritizing safety, trust, and human-centered design."
      detailedDescription:
        - "Carely is not just a chatbot. It is an AI companion designed to support seniors with daily routines, emotional well-being, and memory — while prioritizing safety, trust, and human-centered design. The core challenge wasn't what Carely should say, but how an AI system should remember, reason, and respond responsibly over time."
        - "🧠 <strong>Memory as a First-Class System:</strong> Carely is built with a layered memory architecture that explicitly separates short-term conversational context, long-term personal memory (people, routines, preferences), and temporal grounding (when information is valid). This allows Carely to recall meaningful details, maintain continuity across conversations, and reduce repetition — while minimizing hallucinations. Memory storage and retrieval are explicit, auditable, and designed for safe scaling."
        - "🛡️ <strong>Safety & Guardrails by Design:</strong> Carely embeds guardrails at the system level, not as an afterthought. This includes prompt-level safety constraints and intent detection, emergency escalation workflows that notify caregivers, and validation for ambiguous, emotional, or edge-case inputs. The system is intentionally designed to support—not replace—human caregivers, reinforcing trust and accountability."
        - "🗣️ <strong>Human-Centered Interaction:</strong> Carely focuses on reducing cognitive load through voice-first and chat-based interactions, natural language task completion (mood check-ins, medication logging), and an empathetic, non-robotic conversational tone refined through iteration. Users consistently described Carely as feeling more like a caring companion than a tool."
        - "🧪 <strong>Grounded Evaluation, Not Just Demos:</strong> Carely was evaluated with real users, including seniors and caregivers, across memory recall and continuity, emotional support and reminders, and emergency alert workflows. Usability metrics (UMUX-Lite) and qualitative feedback directly informed UI, memory, and safety improvements."
        - "✨ <strong>Why Carely Matters:</strong> Carely reflects an approach to AI that prioritizes architecture over prompts, safety over novelty, and humans over automation — demonstrating how agentic systems can be built responsibly for real-world use."
